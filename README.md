This project involves the development of a Christmas Escape Room within a mobile application built using Flutter. The app features 10 challenges focused on areas such as networking, operating systems, databases, and logic, designed to test participants' technical knowledge through a series of puzzles and interactive exercises.

The app includes a timer that manages the completion of the set time limits for each challenge, providing a dynamic and controlled experience. Additionally, the system allows tracking the participants' progress, ensuring a structured and challenging gameplay environment.

This project integrates concepts of programming logic, interface design, and time management, offering users an educational and entertaining experience.
